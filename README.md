### TODOs

1. Get to known Landsat scene codes
     https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov

2. Go to python and test downloading
	 Search for additional scripts / approaches

3. In python, get to know how to extract the proper band for "Kelp canopy area and biomass"

4. IIn python, get to know how to adjust image sizes
